# Segmentation Improvement of Under-Segmented Distorted Patterns using Distance Transform

This research work concerns image processing, in particular image segmentation.
It mainly concerns how to improve the segmentation of under-segmented images, using classical image processing methods, especially exploiting the Distance Transform.
